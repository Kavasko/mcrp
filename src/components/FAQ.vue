                <h6>My vehicle is in the water. What should I do?</h6>
                <p>You have to make an ingame support request via your b menu (press B) and going over to the "?" icon.</p>

                <h6>Where can I collect my Paycheck?</h6>

The second way is to use your player interaction menu (which is located in your B menu) and choose the frisk option there. In order to search another player's vehicle you will have to gain access to their keys (in an IC way) or illegally.</p>

                <h6>Why can't I open certain doors?</h6>
                <p>Some buildings and doors will be locked by the owners. They will need to share a key with you for you to enter.</p>

                <h3>Your first steps</h3>
                <p>“So after reading all of this, what do I do?” That's very simple. What we would suggest is that you head over to DMV and get your CDL in order to be able to drive trucks and from there head back to the rental place at the airport to get a vehicle(We would suggest a bicycle if you want to save some money) (press Y on the blue circle). Once you have your rental go to trucking (more information about that can be found at the jobs section of this guide). From there you can start making money. Once you get 2.000$ dollars head over to the central bank, go inside to the tellers and cash in your paycheck. Head over to the store behind the store behind the bank and buy a cellular device (Press I and right click it to equip it(If the cursor doesn't show up press f2)). From there on you can go back to trucking or try other jobs that might suit you better. This is where the “tutorial” ends and your journey begins! Have fun!</p>
